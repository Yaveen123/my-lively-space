            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Anket is a new tab page extension that lets you sign in with your Google account so calendar events can be shown on your new tab page.</p>

            <h2>What data is used</h2>
            <p>Anket requests access to your basic Google profile and Google Calendar data needed to display your upcoming events.</p>

            <h2>How data is used</h2>
            <p>Your calendar data is used only to fetch and render your events in the Anket interface. It is not sold or used for advertising.</p>

            <h2>Storage and retention</h2>
            <p>Only data required for extension functionality is stored. If tokens or temporary event data are cached, they are kept only as long as needed to provide the service.</p>

            <h2>Third-party services</h2>
            <p>Anket relies on Google authentication and Google Calendar APIs. Their handling of your data is also governed by Google’s own terms and privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Your choices</h2>
            <p>You can stop data access at any time by signing out, uninstalling the extension, or revoking app access in your Google account settings.</p>
